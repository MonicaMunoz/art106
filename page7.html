  	<h3>Group:Captain Crunch</h3>
  	<h3>Members: Monica,Vanya,Jacob and Vanessa:</h3>
  	 Vanya and I will work on a duplicate project(Hardware separate and software we might work on it together).
     Jacob and Vanessa will also work with duplicates.
  	<h3>documentation [parts evaluation + initial concept]:</h3>
  	Shared google document for initial evaluation of different parts: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-8bPaMx33EK98k2DbUURwsQB79ryfStTS4fEsUCnJU/edit?usp=sharing">[ here ]</a>
  	<h4>My parts:</h4>
  	<b>Serial based sensor:</b>
  	<br>
  	SparkFun Proximity Sensor Breakout - 20cm, VCNL4040 (Qwiic)
  	<li>$6.95 - okay for the price</li>
    <li>4 pins - easy setup</li>
  	<li>documentation - 7/10 Theres documentation on the website as well as the link to the necessary arduino library</li>
  	<br>
  	<b>Serial based controller/actuator:</b>
  	<br>
  	Zio Qwiic OLED Display (1.5inch, 128x128)
  	<li>$19.99 - Price is a bit expensive</li>
  	<li>4 pins - easy setup</li>
  	<li>I am interested in being able to display imagery and or words in different colors</li>
  	<li>documentation - 7/10 There are some documentation on the website on how to setup</li>
  	<br>
  	<b>Analog output sensor:</b>
  	<br>
  	SparkFun Sound Detector (with Headers)
  	<li>$11.95 - a little pricy</li>
  	<li>I am interested in seeing if I could somehow switch the images and words with it</li>
  	<li>documentation - 7/10 website provides some help as well as youtube videos</li>
  	<br>

  	 <!-- Examples
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<b>Proximity Sensor Breakout</b>
  	<br>
  	<li>instruction sheet for installation: <a href="https://www.uctronics.com/download/Amazon/U602602.pdf">[ here ]</a></li>
  	<li>Requires the Adafruit GFX library and SSD1306 library </li>
  	<li>for the line that says <b>if(!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3D))</b> the 0x3D has to be changed to 0x3C and I'm not sure why that is</li>
  	<video width="400" height="500" controls>

  	</video>
  	<br>
  	<br>
  	<b>oled display</b>
  	<br>
  	<li>the one I got didn't come with instructions for how to code it, so I just followed the example off of sparkfun: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/htu21d-humidity-sensor-hookup-guide/all">[ here ]</a></li>
  	<li>requires the SparkFun HTU21D Breakout library </li>
  	<li>I used the example arduino sketch that was found at the bottom of the page that demonstrated how to talk to the HTU21D sensor</li>
  	<video width="400" height="500" controls>
    		<source src="images/temperature.mov" type="video/mp4">
  	</video>
  		<br>
  	<br>
  	<b>Sound Detector (with Headers)</b>
  	<br>
  	<li>wiring is simple: positive into A0 and negative into ground</li>
  	<li>can use the graph example on arduino w/ serial plotter</li>
  	<li>the knock sensor didn't work all the time for me because I didn't have a 1mohm resistor, but I did notice with the graph example that a 10k resistor makes the piezo sensitive while a 220 resistor makes it less sensitive</li>
