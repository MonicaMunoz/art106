<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p> This is my micro box. To make this music box, I connected according to each piece. I followed diagrams and followed the code on the Beat it download file provided.
The blue toggle button is to turn on or off. The monetary button is to change song/track which in this case is the sound of a ship. The photocell controls the yellow LED which activates 'fading' when it is covered.
The pendiometer contols the speed or tone of the music. </p>
The music box plays to Titanic soundtracks. I chose to paint it a simple dark purple color because it has a nostalgic feeling such as the movie. </p>
