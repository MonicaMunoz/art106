<h2>FINAL</h2>
<br>

<H2> Proposal</H2>

<br>
<li> Since my theme for the prototype is about comfort and children aspects during quarantine, I will continue with the same idea for the final.I plan to continue the MOhardware route and add a neopixel and have the other three  parts(sound,distance,oled) play together to form a nice ambience for the player/viewer. Additionally, I will use the same enclosure- unicorn stuffed animal and attach the neopixel where the nose belongs. I think that this gives it a nice balance of color and visual effects. Lastly, I will add a video that shows a child interacting with it.</li>

<BR>
<H2>Final Project</H2>

<BR>

<li>This project is meant to experience therapeudic moods. Being in quarantine can be very stressful and for some people, it can affect mental health. I think that interacting with a mood toy can be very beneficial for children, especially at a time like this.</li>

<b> Final Videos- how to use </b>

<li> In this video, I have a little model playing with the final toy.</li>
<li>  BLUE - STAY CALM, GREEN - RELAX, RED - BREATHE</li>
<li> After working with the code for some time, I was not able to fix the wording- some words have the last letter repeated. Also, my sound detector is extremly sensitive- it picks up every little sound which can be seen in some of my videos.</li>

<H2> ANOTHER PROJECT  (RGB NUMBERS DISPLAYED INSTEAD OF WORDS)   - USING TASK SCHEDULER</H2>
<br>
<br>


<li> I made another project that has task scheduler using the same parts- OLEd display, sound detector, distance sensor and Neopixel. In this video, I show how the number of the rgb is displayed with the color of neopixel. The values are red, green, and blue. The color changes depending on the amount of sound it picks up and the distance sensor activates the green and red ranges. Blue is automatically there since the oled display only shows- does not give output. The arnge of colors can be orange, pink and lighter versions of them.</li>
