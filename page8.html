<h1>FINAL</h1>
<br>

<li> Proposal</li>

<br>
<li> Since my theme for the prototype is about comfort and children aspects during quarantine, I will continue with the same idea for the final.I plan to continue the MOhardware route and add a neopixel and have the other three  parts(sound,distance,oled) play together to form a nice ambience for the player/viewer. Additionally, I will use the same enclosure- unicorn stuffed animal and attach the neopixel where the nose belongs. I think that this gives it a nice balance of color and visual effects. Lastly, I will add a video that shows a child interacting with it.</li>

<BR>
<B>Final Project</B>

<BR>

<li>This project is meant to experience therapeudic moods. Being in quarantine can be very stressful and for some people, it can affect mental health. I think that interacting with a mood toy can be very beneficial for children, especially at a time like this.</li>

<b> Final Videos- how to use </b>

<li> In this video, I have a little model playing with the final toy.</li>
<li>  BLUE - STAY CALM, GREEN - RELAX, RED - BREATHE</li>
<li> After working with the code for some time, I was not able to fix the wording- some words have the last letter repeated. Also, my sound detector is extremly sensitive- it picks up every little sound which can be seen in some of my videos.</li>
